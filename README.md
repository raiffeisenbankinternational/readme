# seancorfield.readme

A simple library that turns examples in your `README.md` file into tests and runs them!

This project follows the version scheme MAJOR.MINOR.COMMITS where MAJOR and MINOR provide some relative indication of the size of the change, but do not follow semantic versioning. In general, all changes endeavor to be non-breaking (by moving to new names rather than by breaking existing names). COMMITS is an ever-increasing counter of commits since the beginning of this repository.

Latest stable release: 1.0.16

## Usage

Add an alias to your `~/.clojure/deps.edn` file:

``` clojure
    :readme {:extra-deps {seancorfield/readme {:mvn/version "1.0.16"}}
             :main-opts ["-m" "seancorfield.readme"]}
```

Then the most basic usage is:

    clojure -M:readme

This turns `README.md`'s examples into tests in `src/readme.clj`, loads and runs them, and then deletes that generated file (line numbers in failures should match line numbers in your original `README.md` file).

You can optionally provide a different file path for the readme and for the generated file:

    clojure -M:readme test/seancorfield/readme_example.md src/generated_test.clj

> Note: The output file path must be on your classpath so that the generated namespace can be `require`'d. The generated file will be deleted after running the tests (unless it cannot be `require`'d due to syntax errors, when it will be left in place for you to debug).

If your `README.md` file contains a REPL session (using a `=> ` prompt, with space) such as:

    ```clojure
    => some-expression
    result-1
    => another-expression
    result-2
    ```

This will generate tests file in target/src of the form:

``` clojure
(deftest readme-N ; N is the line number
  (is (= result-1 some-expression))
  (is (= result-2 another-expression)))
```
Each test is generated in separate file. 

Tests are split into blocks of `exected` and `actual`. Each expected block starts with `=> ` and ends 
when first line starts in beggninig. Actual block then continue untill end of file is reached or
next expected block starts. 

Each `clojure` code block will become a standalone test (if it contains `=>`). The tests may be executed in any order (by `clojure.test/run-tests`). Expressions that are not considered to be parts of any tests will be executed in order when the generated test namespace is loaded (by this `readme` library).

If you wish to add Clojure-formatted code to your README that is _ignored_ by this library, use whitespace between the triple backtick and `clojure`, like this:

    ``` clojure
    ;; ignored by seancorfield/readme
    (do-stuff 42)
    ```

## Caveats

You cannot use `ns` (or `in-ns`) forms in these examples, because the generated tests are all assumed to be in a single namespace (derived from the generated test filename).

Printed output is not considered when running tests. If the REPL session in your readme file needs to show output, it is recommended to show it as comments like this, so that it will be ignored by the generated tests:

```clojure
=> (println (+ 1 2 3))
;; prints:
; 6
nil
```

## Examples
This is an example readme file.

It has some setup:

```clojure
=> (:require [clojure.string :as str])
```

and an example using `=>`:

```clojure
=> (:require [clojure.string :as str])
=> (str/starts-with? "example" "ex")
true
```

and a series of examples using `=>`:

```clojure
=> (+ 1 2 3)
;; comments
6
; are
; ignored
=> (* 1 2 3)
6
=> (- 1 2 3)
-4
=> (println "Hello!")
;; prints:
; Hello!
nil
```

and another `=>` example with trailing forms:

```clojure
=> (:require [clojure.string :as str])
=> (str/ends-with? "example" "nope")
(do (println "This should print!")
    false)
```


## Development

Run the tests:

    $ clojure -M:test:runner

Build a deployable jar of this library:

    $ clojure -M:jar

Install it locally:

    $ clojure -M:install

Deploy it to Clojars -- needs `CLOJARS_USERNAME` and `CLOJARS_PASSWORD` environment variables:

    $ clojure -M:deploy
